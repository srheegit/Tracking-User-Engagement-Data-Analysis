# Tracking-User-Engagement
We shall use SQL, Excel, and Python to track user engagement of an education platform.  We will determine whether the new additions to the platform (new courses, exams, and career tracks) have increased student engagement. The data, as well as the background of this data analysis, came from 365datascience.com; all work are my own.

"The first half of 2022 was expected to be profitable for the company. The reason was the hypothesized increased student engagement after the release of several new features on the company’s website at end-2021. These include enrolling in career tracks and testing your knowledge through practice, course, and career track exams. Of course, we have also expanded our course library to increase user engagement and the platform’s audience as more topics are covered. By comparing different metrics, we can measure the effectiveness of these new features and the overall engagement of our users."
